        <h1>Discrimination</h1>
        
        <p>Greetings, to whoever would like to hear about these unfortunate ordeals, the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. Discrimination is synonymous to criticism; and the main murderer of a positive mindset. The question is, why do people discriminate against us? If they know that discriminating is a negative thing, then why bother? The answer is, they discriminate against us so that they could feel satisfied. Sometimes they get embarrassed for what they’ve done, that they forget that they were the ones who started discriminating, but it’s fine, you don’t have to listen, and try to comprehend whatever they say. They’re selfish, they don’t know that they are, but only we know. Nothing can tear you down, you’re inevitable. You are a <span class="highlight">star</span>, huge and bright, and the meteorites are the people who discriminate against you. That’s what you are, you are so valuable that you can’t be worth money. The people discriminating against you are likely discriminating against the air. Use the discrimination that comes from other people as a stepping stone that could make you more beautiful than your past self, which kept regretting being discriminated against by others.</p>
